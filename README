I.    WHAT IS DDER?

It is a minimalistic program to display the content of DER (Distinguished
Encoding Rules) encoded files.
See URL
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690#DER_encoding
for details about DER encoding.



II.   WHY DDER?

It displays der content in a very detailed way. It is meant to be didactic.

The command
    openssl asn1parse
does a perfect job but without displaying the low level file content (and it
not its job to do that.)

dder displays der content with low level file content in hexadecimal.



III.  LICENCE

See COPYING file that comes along with the package the program belongs to.



IV.   COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION

* LINUX

To compile under Linux, execute in the extracted archive root:
    ./configure
    make
    make install (or 'sudo make install')

* WINDOWS

To compile under Windows with Microsoft Visual C++ 2015, launch MSVC
command-line and, in the extracted archive root, execute:
    nmake -f makefile.vc
